## About This Project: 

This project was made with the goal of testing my abilities in HTML and CSS to ensure I had properly learned the content and processes and could solve problems myself without the usage of tools to help me, though I do understand tools are useful, this project was primarily used to prove to myself that I had a good grasp of basic web development. Almost all of the javascript in this project was written by me directly however some certain functions e.g/ the date, were written by AiStudio.com, please keep that in mind if reading the code. This is also my first project using GitHub so please acknowledge there may be mistakes in that matter. Thank's for reading!
